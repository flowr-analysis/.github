# Analyzing R Code to Improve Program Comprehension

We work on [_flowR_](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/flowr), a program analyzer for the R programming language.

If you want to check it out, it is probably best to try its [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=code-inspect.vscode-flowr) or its [RStudio addin](https://github.com/flowr-analysis/rstudio-addin-flowr).
